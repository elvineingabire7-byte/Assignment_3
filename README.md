In MoMo,:
1.	I enter the code.
2.	I enter PIN.

Stack Practical 2
UR:
•	I push or add  Chapter 1, then Chapter 2, then Chapter 3 on a stack.

•	I’m left with only Chapter 1.

Queue Practical 2
Again, people line up.
The first person is served, then the second.
The program shows who the second person was.
